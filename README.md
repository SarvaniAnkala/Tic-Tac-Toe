# Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple interface, allowing two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. It includes game logic to determine wins, losses, and draws.  This project demonstrates my skills in web development, DOM manipulation, and CSS grid layout.
